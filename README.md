## Project Overview

Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) is the process of converting spoken language into written text. This repository demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate ASR models, and provides scripts to test model performance on various datasets.

## Features

- End-to-end speech-to-text pipeline
- Preprocessing and feature extraction
- Model training and evaluation scripts
- Support for custom datasets
- Example notebooks and scripts

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ritupriya17/Automated-Speech-Recognition-for-Text-Conversion.git
    cd Automated-Speech-Recognition-for-Text-Conversion
    ```
2. Install dependencies (update as needed):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment for better package management.

## Usage

- To train a new model:
    ```bash
    python train.py --config configs/train_config.yaml
    ```
- To evaluate a trained model:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py --model checkpoints/best_model.pth
    ```
- For demo/inference on audio files:
    ```bash
    python transcribe.py --audio sample.wav
    ```

## Model Details

- List the models used (e.g., DeepSpeech, Wav2Vec2, etc.).
- Briefly describe preprocessing steps and feature extraction.
- Mention any hyperparameters or configuration files.

## Dataset

- Describe the dataset(s) used (e.g., LibriSpeech, Common Voice, custom datasets).
- Provide instructions or links to download the data.

## Results

- Summarize key results, such as Word Error Rate (WER), Character Error Rate (CER), or sample outputs.
- Include plots, tables, or links to further analysis.
